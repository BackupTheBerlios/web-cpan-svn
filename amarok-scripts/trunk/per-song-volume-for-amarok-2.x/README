This Amarok 2.x script maintains a per-song volume information. What it means 
is  that a volume is associated with each song, which is recorded whenever the
volume changes, and is restored to its last value when the song is played
again. This is useful if you have several songs which sound louder or softer
than the rest.

To run this script you need Amarok 2.x, QtSql and 
qt4-database-plugin-sqlite .

The file "$HOME/.kde4/share/apps/amarok/scripts-data/per-song-volume.default-volume.txt"
can optionally hold the default volume for playing the files (an integer
from 0 to 100). The default setting for it is 40.

I hope you find this script useful!

Now for a rant: I spent more than 3 hours converting this script from the
working Perl 5 script for Amarok 1.x. I resented the Amarok developers for
breaking the old Amarok 1.x script interface, and think that JavaScript is
a poor choice for a project's exclusive scripting language. ( It's necessary
for writing browser-side scripts on the web, but it wouldn't have been the
best choice, retrospectively there, either. )

In any case, I would much rather this script would have been kept as Perl
or at least written in Ruby or Python or something. But JavaScript gave me
a lot of problems in the past (doing greasemonkey scripts, etc.) and has
given me some grief when writing this version of the script.

So (The Amarok Core Developers)-- .
