Long-term:
----------

* Find a way to restrict the width of the table to the width of the 
input cells.

* Add a job add management : password + E-mail to remove it or renew
it after it expires.

* Research Hebrew Integration.

* Create an administration page.

* Fix the Broken Records.

* Put on CPAN.

* Write a search form for another search on the search results page.

* Find a way to do a spacing in the add job form table. I'd like that two 
arbitrary rows will have a spacing between them.
