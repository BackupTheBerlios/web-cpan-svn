<latemp_version_control_id "$Id$" />

<h2>What is Fullperl?</h2>

<p>
The Perl core distribution is very minimalistic and contains only mostly
bare modules. One thing PHP, Java and to a lesser extent Python got right
is making the core distribution fully functional, which allows for people
to easily write sophisticated applications that require only the core 
functionality. <b>Fullperl</b> aims to provide a fully functional (<b>"Batteries
included"</b>) perl 5 distribution.
</p>

<h2>The Fullperl Mission</h2>

<p>
Fullperl aims to be a cross-OS-and-distribution distribution of perl 5 with 
the following goals:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Be packaged using the OS-distribution's native packages if possible.
</li>
<li>
Contain portable packages for many CPAN modules.
</li>
<li>
Contain meta-packages for common tasks (such as web development (CGI/mod_perl), database connectivity and abstraction, web automation, GUI development, etc.).
</li>
<li>
Encourage administrators to install the appropriate meta-packages for their 
consistent.
</li>
<li>
Provide an ability (while taking the hosting environment constraints into account) to depend on a particular behaviour of the system.
</li>
<li>
All of this while maintaining a very liberal end-user license agreement (EULA) and re-distribution terms. (as opposed to say ActivePerl)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Fullperl will at first direct UNIX clones and distributions (Linux, the BSDs,
Solaris, etc.), where most of the serious deployment of Perl takes place, but
in the future it may extend to also covering Win32 (on top of the planned
"Chocolate Perl" or "Strawberry Perl" distributions).
