Most of the web-cpan repository is either MIT X11, or if derived
from original code, usually GPL+Artistic with the rights disclaimed.

However, Drupal is distributed under the GPL. The LocalSettings.php file
will probably be under MIT X11 too, and so will the per-site customisations.

So this is an exception.
